# Michael Tamaki weekly updates

## 02-27-2017

- **Past week:** Investigated blog post bug in the website project, continue 
debugging deploying cesium_web onto local computer
- **Got stuck on:** Lots of cesium_web PRs have been merged, so I am debugging
while updating
- **Coming week:** Once everything is set regarding installation, I am thinking
about making a common problems/solutions list. Other than that, I will continue
looking into the walkthrough PR.
