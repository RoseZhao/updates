## 02-24-2017

- **Past week:** Met the team, got the web app up and running both locally and with Docker, read the codebase and study React. 
- **Got stuck on:** Got trouble while setting up the app locally because of missing dependencies, wrong Python version and forgot to kill running server.
- **Coming week:** Learn more about React to help Michael and Wei with troubleshooting the click-through tutorial ticket.
