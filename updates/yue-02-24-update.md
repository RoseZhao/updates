# Past week

- Went over unsharp masking paper with Kostya and Stefan
- Wrote code for most part of the algorithm described in the paper 

# Next week

- Finish writing an initial version implementation of unsharp masking.

# Issues

- Unsure of how to implement adaptive updates for lambda1 and lambda2.
