Past week:

Issues:
> Had a few issues with finding the page_hba file in my computer. Also had a few issues with using vim and adding to the file. 

<hr/>

Past week: 
> Alejandro and I updated the read me file and made it more detailed. Alejandro made the pull request.

Next week:
> Will work on one of the tasks. I will also read the source code to learn more about the project.

Issues:
> We could not find the license information.

<hr/>

Past week: 
> I worked with Brett to get the cesium web running properly on my laptop (without using docker). I am also working on adding table creation to `tools/db_create.sh`. I was in Houston all last week for a conference, so I will be sure to get more done in this upcoming week.

Next week:
> I will work with somebody to add a home button to the website. After that, I will pick up another task.

Issues:
> None yet!

<hr/>

Past week: 
> I worked with Jie to learn more about the website. We are currently adding a hover effect to the main icon. I also fixed the issues with the db_create file.

Next week:
> I will work more on the hover effect and pick up another task.

Issues:
> We were not sure how to combine the theme and website repo. 

<hr/>

Past week: 
> I wrote code to add the hover effect to the website; however, I have not tested it yet since I am having trouble running the website. I am also finishing up the readme with Alejandro today. 

Next week:
> I would like to learn more about the Architectural Diagram task so I can get started.

Issues:
> I am having trouble running the website on my machine - hopefully we can discuss this at the meeting. I also want to learn how to get started on making an Architectural Diagram.

<hr/>

Past week: 
> I finished the cesium website README with Alejandro. I also looked through the github repo on react walkthroughs - they seem very neat! I started doing the setup and converting the js to jsx.

Next week:
> I will continue working on the React walkthoughs. I would also like to get started on the Architectural Diagram when I finish the walkthroughs.

Issues:
> I am only a little familiar with javascript and react, but I am learning more about it through the setup.

<hr/>

Past week: 
> I read some of the redux.js documentation and worked on the walkthroughs. I have them showing on the screen and moving, but I am working with Jie to refine some of the code

Next week:
> I will continue working on the React walkthoughs. I need to change the color of the background and text that is displayed on each walkthrough step. I think we are getting close!

Issues:
> I am having trouble changing background and descriptions for each step of the walkthrough. I feel like the changes I make in main.jsx are not reflecting when I run make.
